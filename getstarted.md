## Download

First, download the DocMkr zip or tar file to any directory on your computer and unzip it. The DocMkr zip file contains just one executable file, so after unzipping it, there's nothing to install.

## Run DocMkr

For convenience, consider adding the directory location of the DocMkr executable to your system path for ease of use. That way you can type `docmkr` from any directory on your system.

If you choose not to add the DocMkr directory to your path, you'll have to change directories to the location of your DocMkr executable and type `docmkr` or `.\docmkr` in Windows PowerShell command prompts.
