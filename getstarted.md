## Run DocMkr

For convenience, consider adding the directory location of the DocMkr executable to your system path for ease of use. That way you can type `docmkr` from any directory on your system.

If you choose not to add the DocMkr directory to your path, you'll have to change directories to the location of your DocMkr executable and type `docmkr` or `.\docmkr` in Windows PowerShell command prompts.
